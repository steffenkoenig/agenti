**agenti** is an AI-powered, self-evolving repository management system built on [GitHub Agentic Workflows (gh-aw)](https://github.com/github/gh-aw). It deploys a team of autonomous AI agents that continuously audit your codebase, open GitHub Issues for findings, implement those issues as pull requests, and even improve the agents themselves — all on a recurring schedule with no human intervention required.

At its core, agenti closes the loop between code review and code change: a reviewer agent scans the repository and files structured issues; an implementer agent picks those issues up and submits pull requests; and a workflow-management agent keeps all the underlying automation up to date. The result is a living repository that reflexively repairs and improves itself around the clock.

```

Both scheduled agents run every two hours, are scoped to the `main` branch, and use a concurrency lock so only one instance of each agent runs at a time. All agent outputs go through a safe-outputs firewall that caps the number of issues, pull requests, and comments an agent can create per run, preventing runaway automation.

## Agents

### 1. Agenti Reviewer (`agenti-reviewer`)

A **Senior Architect / Repository Sentinel** that performs holistic, recursive audits of the entire repository. It reviews:

- **Code & Infrastructure** — logic efficiency, modernization opportunities, DRY/SOLID violations
- **Testing & Resilience** — coverage gaps, test quality, flaky tests
- **Documentation** — bus-factor risks, docs that are out of sync with code
- **Agents & Workflows (Recursive)** — reviews the other agents, proposes new specialist agents, and audits itself

For each finding the reviewer opens a structured GitHub Issue containing a current-state/desired-state description, impact rating (Critical / Warning / Enhancement), a step-by-step proposed solution, and a checklist of acceptance criteria.

**Safe-output limits per run:** max 10 issues · max 10 comments · max 1 noop

### 2. Issue Implementer (`issue-implementer`)

An **Autonomous Software Engineer** that fetches all open GitHub Issues, prioritizes them using explicit labels, community reactions, comments, and age, then implements up to 5 issues per run (subject to safe-output limits). For each run it:

1. Produces a detailed task list for the selected issues (understanding, affected files, implementation steps, tests, docs, acceptance criteria)
2. Makes the required code changes
3. Adds or updates tests and documentation
4. Opens one or more pull requests referencing the implemented issues (possibly grouping several issues per pull request to honor safe-output limits)

**Safe-output limits per run:** max 5 pull requests · max 10 comments · max 1 noop

### 3. Agentic Workflows Agent (`agentic-workflows`)

A **Dispatcher / Workflow Engineer** helper agent intended for manual, on-demand use (there is no scheduled workflow that runs it automatically). It routes requests to specialized sub-prompts for:

- Creating and updating workflow definitions (`.github/workflows/*.md`)
- Compiling `.md` sources to `.lock.yml` files via `gh aw compile`
- Debugging failed workflow runs
- Upgrading the gh-aw extension version across all workflows
- Generating reports and shared reusable workflow components

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Version | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| [GitHub CLI (`gh`)](https://cli.github.com/) | ≥ 2.x | Required by gh-aw extension |
| [gh-aw extension](https://github.com/github/gh-aw) | v0.53.6+ | Compiles and runs agentic workflows |
| GitHub Copilot | Business or Enterprise | Powers the AI agents |
| `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` secret | — | Repository secret used by workflows for API access |

## Setup

### 1. Fork or clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/steffenkoenig/agenti.git
cd agenti
```

### 2. Install the GitHub CLI and gh-aw extension

```bash
# Install GitHub CLI (see https://cli.github.com/ for platform-specific instructions)
gh auth login

# Install the gh-aw extension
gh extension install github/gh-aw
```

### 3. Configure repository secrets

In your repository settings, add the following secret:

| Secret | Description |
|---|---|
| `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` | A GitHub token with `repo` and `copilot` scopes |

### 4. Enable GitHub Actions

Ensure GitHub Actions is enabled for your repository. The compiled lock files (`.github/workflows/*.lock.yml`) are already checked in and will be picked up automatically by GitHub Actions.

### 5. (Optional) Edit agent prompts

Agent behavior is defined in plain-English markdown files under `.github/agents/`. Edit these files to customize how the agents operate, then commit your changes. No recompilation is needed for agent prompt-only edits — recompilation is only required when you change a workflow definition file (`.github/workflows/*.md`).

## Workflows

| Workflow | Schedule | Trigger | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Agenti Reviewer** | Every 2 hours | `schedule` / `workflow_dispatch` | Audits the repo and opens GitHub Issues |
| **Issue Implementer** | Every 2 hours | `schedule` / `workflow_dispatch` | Implements open issues and opens PRs |
| **Copilot Setup Steps** | On push / manual | `push` / `workflow_dispatch` | Provisions the gh-aw CLI environment |

Both primary workflows run only on the `main` branch and use a concurrency group to prevent parallel runs of the same workflow.

## Usage

### Trigger manually

```bash
# Run the reviewer agent once
gh workflow run agenti-reviewer.lock.yml

# Run the issue implementer once
gh workflow run issue-implementer.lock.yml
```

### Let it run automatically

Once the repository secrets are set and GitHub Actions is enabled, both workflows will trigger on their two-hour cron schedules automatically. No further action is required.

### Customize the agents

Open any file in `.github/agents/` in your editor. GitHub Copilot is enabled for markdown files in this repository, so you can use Copilot to help you refine agent instructions.

After editing an agent file, simply commit your changes. Recompilation is only required if you also modify a workflow definition in `.github/workflows/*.md` (see the [Contributing](#contributing) section).

## Contributing

1. **Open an issue** — describe the bug, enhancement, or question. The Agenti Reviewer will periodically audit the repo and may open issues automatically too.
2. **Fork & branch** — create a feature branch from `main`.
3. **Make changes** — follow the existing code style; keep commits small and focused.
4. **Compile workflows** — if you edit any `.github/workflows/*.md` file, run `gh aw compile` and commit the resulting `.lock.yml`.
5. **Open a pull request** — reference the related issue in the PR description.

> **Note:** The Issue Implementer agent runs every two hours and may implement open issues automatically.
